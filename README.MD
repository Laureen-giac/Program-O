# Program O Version 3: A Completely New Creature

readme info:
- Version:   3.0.0
- Authors: Dave Morton
- Date: May 28th, 2016


## Introduction


Program O Version 3 is an AIML interpretor written in PHP, but unlike previous versions,
will (probably) not use a MySQL database to store the chatbot's information or AIML,
though the option to use a database to store user/admin information will be available.
But this is left to the administrator to set up and configure.

## Requirements


For now, Program O version 3 requires only PHP version 5.3 or higher, but that may change
as development continues. We'll try to keep the requirements as low as possible (no bleeding
edge features), but as more functionality is brouguht online it's possible that we'll have
to raise the requirements.

## Installation

As with prior versions of Program O, installaton will be as painless and simple as humanly
possible. A self-installing script will guide you through a step-by-step process of
installation and configuration of your chatbot(s), and a set of admin pages will allow for
configuration of the chatbot, it's map and set files, and it's predicates.

## Using the bot
